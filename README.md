# Python

Projects to Show some of the skills I've learned in python

### Access.py in the tkinter folder
To many people have a text file with all their logins and Passwords, so why not make it searchable.  I made a program that will take sqlite3 and create a database to store and update your passwords.  Not very secure but it beats having a text file names passwrds.

### Tk timer from treehouse
The timer.py in the tkinter folder is an example of a simple timer using Tk and ways to use the alert messagebox.  Just another thing to play around with.

### Bible Trivia
The Bible Trivia folder contains a program that uses Tkinter to create a Bible Trivia game.  It has a couple of methods that does some webscraping to create the database for the game.  I only scraped Matthew and Mark from [biblegateway](www.biblegateway.com).  The game uses a list of key words that will be removed from the verse and ask the user to fill in the blank(s).  

### Wx-Archive-folders.py and Tk-archiving-folders.py
Using Wx and Tk I created programs for a class project that wanted to move all the files in a certain folder into a backup folder.  The Wx-Archive-folders.py allows the user to pick the source and destination folders. It also creates and adds all moves into a datadase using sqlite3.  Tk-archiving-folders has hard coded folders, which is what the project asked for. Wx and Tk are ways of turning python which is normally a console language into a GUI.

### card-war.py
This is one of the first python projects. The class called for a program that used random numbers and while loops, so I made a quick little program that lets the user bet on the simple car game of war.  It's not fancy, but it shows looping and the use of random methods.
